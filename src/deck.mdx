That's some robot carnage.
And if you want to beat Mike, you too can make a robot

# Making a robot

- Fork `carbonfive/kablammo-template`
- Includes a `kablammo-strategy` SDK gem
- Implement an `on_turn` function
  - Robot gets acess to the board and any visible bots
  - `on_turn` returns commands like "move N" or "shoot"
- Robot can keep state in memory

---

# The simplest bot

```ruby
on_turn do
  fire!
end
```

---

# How does a game work?

- Players register github repos for robots
- A tournament is 2 to 4 robots
- Kablammo checks out repos and runs each in its own process
- Communicates over Redis
- Kablammo sends the game state to every bot, gets a move back
- Executes the moves in an engine
- If a robot times out, it stops playing
- The game is saved and replayed on the client

# Can you just `bundle install` a 2013 Ruby project?

# Resurecting Kablammo

- Ruby 1.9.3: 💀
- `mongo_mapper`: 💀
- Switch to `Mongoid` and Ruby 2.6 🔧
- Upgrade all the other Gems 💎

<Notes>

- So what happend?
- Ruby 1.9 doesn't even install on Mac Mojave
- mongo_mapper, the ORM, was dead, and didn't work on 2.6
- So step one was to update to Ruby 2.6 and change to using a different ORM
- That took a lot of little fixing, but then...

# Kablammo Uprades

- Bigger maps 🌎
- Easier to draw maps 🗺️
- Move-and-turn 💃
- Mobile-friendly game animation 📱
- Testing &amp; CI 🧪
- Test helpers for bot creators 🤖

<Notes>

Once it was working again, we added some upgrades

</Notes>

---

# Future work (for your next bench time?)

- Better bot documentation
- More bot helpers
- Auto Tournaments
- Power-ups

<Notes>

Some things that would be good bench projects

</Notes>

# Bot building tips

- Remember where hidden bots are
- Turn turrent while hidden
- Don't forget to reload

<Notes>


- The engine will only tell your bot about enemys it can see. But once you see a bot, you can remember where it is, and guess where it was going
- Sitting still and turning is a good way to get shot. A good strategy is to see an oppoent, hide, turn your turrent, then pop back out and shoot
- You have to sit still to reload, so do that when you can so you don't run out of bullets at the wrong time
